I would like to thank the Nik Arkharov and team at EROAD for the given exercise. <br>
Below I will outline:

- How start the local development server, run test, and build the project
- Summary on the given objectives
- My analysis for the given problem which goes into details of choice of data structure, the "ideal process", choice of technology
- How I structure the code and why I structure it in the way I do
- A little more on the design, design concept, and design systems

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the code

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

## Objectives

The main objectives are summarized below.

**`achieved`** Render yearly view:
* All months
* Dates labelled with Mon-Sun on top
* All dates arranged so that it is clear to see which day of the week it is

**`achieved`** Ability to mark date as one of the following categories and each should have a different color:
  + Holiday
  + Birthday
  + Busy
  + Anniversary
  
**`achieved`** Ability to remove special categories from the date

**`achieved`** By default today date should be distinguishable from the rest of the days

**`achieved`** Ability to move between year without losing data

## Analysis
